# Web application structure:
Outline the structure of your solution (routes & functions, and templates). This should be 
brief and can be text-based or a diagram (as an image). 
It must indicate how your routes, functions and templates relate to each other, as well as 
what data is being passed between them.
Do not just give a list of your routes. Do not include all of your code. This relates to the 
code, not the user experience – so do not describe the interface, user experience or HTML 
layout.

# Design decisions:
Discuss the design decisions you made when designing and developing your app: what 
design options you weighed up, why you designed your app the way that you did, your 
decisions about the routes, templates, navigation, broad layout, etc., that you made.
For example, when the edit button is clicked on a page, does that open a different template 
for editing or does it use the same template with IF statements to enable the editing? Did 
you use GET or POST to request and send data, and how and why? You will have considered 
many design possibilities. These are only two examples. 
Note your decisions as you work, so you do not forget them!

# Database questions: Refer to the supplied spb_local.sql file to answer the following questions:
1. What SQL statement creates the job table and defines its fields/columns? (Copy and 
paste the relevant lines of SQL.)
2. Which line of SQL code sets up the relationship between the customer and job
tables?
3. Which lines of SQL code insert details into the parts table?
4. Suppose that as part of an audit trail, the time and date a service or part was added 
to a job needed to be recorded, what fields/columns would you need to add to 
which tables? Provide the table name, new column name and the data type. (Do not
implement this change in your app.)
5. Suppose logins were implemented. Why is it important for technicians and the office 
administrator to access different routes? As part of your answer, give two specific 
examples of problems that could occur if all of the web app facilities were available 
to everyone.

# Image sources: It is not necessary to use any external images in your web app, but if you do, 
ensure you reference the image source in your report
